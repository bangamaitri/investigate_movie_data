# Project: Investigating TMDb Movies Dataset

## Introduction

> This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.
>
> We will be exploring a few things here like, which genres are most popular from year to year, what kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues and which directors do high budget movies comparitively.

## Data Wrangling

> Looking at the first few values of data, shape of data, data types of columns and checking if the data has any NA Values and duplicate values. Looking at the summary statistics of the data.

## Data Cleaning:
> This will involve removing NA(replacing with mean), removing duplicates, changing datatypes Since the names of the columns are already as desired, we won't change them
